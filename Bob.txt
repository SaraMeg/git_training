Hi! I'm Bobby. I've been here for a while.
i'm making a second change because I obviously didnt follow directions right.
changing bob on the master (???)
<<<<<<< HEAD
Master Bob is apparently 5 commits away from the branch. I'm not sure how that happened but I'll look.
=======
im curious how this rebase thing works.  so this change is to bobbybranch.
>>>>>>> Bobby_Branch

I'm editing Bobby on the website.
